# Ames-House-Prices: 
### Feature Engineering And Exploratory Data Analysis With Python

# Problem Statement:
While searching for the dream house, the buyer looks at various factors, not just at the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad.
Using the dataset, find the factors that influence price negotiations while buying a house.


The following steps will be performed:

## 1. Understand the dataset:
### Identify the shape of the dataset
### Identify variables with null values
### Identify variables with unique values

## 2.Generate a separate dataset for numerical and categorical variables
### 2.1 EDA of numerical variables:
#### Missing value treatment
#### Identify the skewness and distribution
#### Identify significant variables using a correlation matrix 
#### Pair plot for distribution and density
### 2.2 EDA of categorical variables
#### Missing value treatment
#### Count plot and box plot for bivariate analysis
#### Identify significant variables using p-values and Chi-Square values

### 3. Combine all the significant categorical and numerical variables

### 4. Plot box plot for the new dataset to find the variables with outliers
